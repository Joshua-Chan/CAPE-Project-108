# CAPE-Project-108

Project created with other project members to find differences in characteristics between STEM and non-STEM classes. STEM classes were manually identified to be as Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics classes. STEM classes were identified by what department their course code is based on, so MATH 20B is a STEM class, but LIGN 167 is not a STEM class even though it is a class on Deep Learning. If classes were classified by the material that was taught, it would be too difficult to manually classify classes.

Permutation tests were written to identify if differences between STEM and non-STEM were statistically significant. Afterwards, Linear Regression Fitting was done to see the relationship between two variables.
